# CELEB PROFILE: HOLLY HERNDON
Holly Herdon is an electronic music producer right at the intersection between technology and music, which I find inspiring. She studied Machine Learning and Sound at Stanford, and then went on to produce an album, with sounds implemented of her 'AI baby', which learnt to speak through her and her bandmates voices.
She is a very active speaker about ownership of one's own voice/sound, and the future of AI and music, and has created a podcast called Interdependence where she discusses this and other topics.
